# DataJam-NPC19

A collection of starter Jupyter notebooks for the NPC19 DataJam.

## Getting Started

### Cloning Locally (recommended)

1. Install [Anaconda Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
2. Install git. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is recommended if you're new to git.
3. Use git/GitHub desktop to clone this repository to your local machine.
4. On MacOS or other `*nixes`, launch a terminal and navigate to where you cloned this repo. On Windows, launch an Anaconda Prompt (should be in the Start Menu under Anaconda)
5. Create and activate a conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:

```sh
conda env create -f enviroment.yml
```
6. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

It should open a web browser automatically. If not, look at the terminal output for the URL + token to enter.

### Using Hosted Azure Notebook

All you need for this one is a modern web browser. Navigate to

**NOTE BENE**

This is a public JupyterHub open to anyone! As such, here are The Rules:

1. Do not put anything you wouldn't want the whole world reading in there.
2. Do not intentionally (and try really hard not to accidentally) delete or modify someone else's data. Don't be a jerk in general.
3. Create a folder using your name or chosen handle or some way of uniquely identifying it to you as your workspace; try to not gunk up the top-level and GIS/GTFS directories.
4. This server will remain up for one week after the conclusion of the DataJam (i.e., through Saturday, April 20th, 2019). If you want to preserve your work, the easiest way will be to create an account with Microsoft Azure and clone this project to your account. See the [Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/azure-notebooks-user-account) for more information.
